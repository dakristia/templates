This is a batteries-included template for creating a dotnet application in Intility. It includes the boilerplate for setting up the most common services a dotnet app needs, and is aimed to get you up and running quickly.

While the template takes away a lot of the complexity of starting a new app, we still recommend you to read the documentation for the libraries and services included in the template. This will help you understand how to use them, and how to configure them to your needs. See [Further Reading](/dotnet/further-reading) for links to the documentation of the libraries and services included in the template.

### Available Templates

#### Intility Api (`iwebapi`)
