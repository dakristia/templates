First and foremost make sure you have installed the [official dotnet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 9.

```shell
#install intility templates
dotnet new install Intility.Templates
```

:::info
It's recommended to run this command every time you want to use the template,
to ensure you're using the newest version.

New templates should now be available to bootstrap new projects from. Use `dotnet new list` to see available templates

## Updating the template

:::warning
Earlier versions of the CLI had troubles updating packages due to long-lived caches.
You need to be on version 5.0.301 or higher for updating to work properly.
:::

:::note
This will not update already bootstrapped projects.
:::

Check for updates by running

```shell
dotnet new update --check-only
```

If there are any updates available, update with

```shell
dotnet new update
```

or

```shell
dotnet new install Intility.Templates
```
