The example code is set up to use authorization. For this to work, an App Registration has to be set up in Azure AD.

### API

Head over to [Azure -> Azure Active Directory -> App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)
with your Intility Account, and create a new registration.

![New Registration in Azure](/img/azure-new-dotnet.png)  
Select a fitting name for your project, this name will be presented to the user during consent.

Under `Supported account types`, choose either `Intility AS only - Single tenant` or `Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant`.
This can be changed later, so if you're unsure what to choose, select single tenant.

Leave the `Redirect URI` section blank.

Hit the register button, and you will be taken to an overview of your newly created registration.

:::tip Copy the `Application (Client) ID` GUID
Copy the `Application (Client) ID` GUID, and save it for later. We will use this ID when we create our project.
:::

### Add an application scope

Go to Expose an API in your app registration, and add a scope.
You will be prompted to set an Application ID URI.
Use the suggested one, and hit Save and continue.

![Add a scope](/img/azure-add-scope.png)

Add a scope named `user_impersonation`, that can be consented by `Admins and users`.

You can use the following descriptions:

```
Access API as user
Allows the app to access the API as the user.

Access API as you
Allows the app to acces the API as you.
```

## Swagger

In addition to creating an App Registration for the API itself, we need to make one for the Swagger client too.
Again head over to [Azure -> Azure Active Directory -> App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps).

![New Registration in Azure](/img/azure-new-swagger.png)

Use the same name appended with `Swagger`.

Under `Redirect URI`, select `Single-page application (SPA)` and enter `http://localhost:5000/oauth2-redirect.html`.

Hit the register button, and you will be taken to an overview of your newly created registration.

![Finding Client ID](/img/azure-clientid-swagger.png)
:::tip Copy the `Application (Client) ID` GUID
Copy the `Application (Client) ID` GUID, and save it for later. This ID will also be used when we create our project.
:::

### Adding reply URLs

For each deployment of your app, you'll need to register it. You can do that by going to the Authentication page.

![Adding Reply URLs](/img/azure-replyurls-swagger.png)  
The first reply URLs we need to add are the localhost https URL, and the OpenShift deploy URL:

```
https://localhost:5001/oauth2-redirect.html
https://{your-project-slug}-dev.apps.int.intility.no/oauth2-redirect.html
```

You can also add more later if you create more environments.

### Access API

To allow Swagger to talk to the API, you need to add API permissions to the Swagger app registration.
Go to API permissions, and hit Add a permission.
Under My APIs, find your API, select the scope(s) and press Add permissions.

![Add API permission](/img/azure-api-permissions.png)

## Guest users

The template comes with an authorization policy that denies guest users in Azure AD from accessing the API.
This policy is enabled when the application is not set up as multitenant.
If you want guest users to access your single tenant API, simply remove the lines applying the policy.

```csharp title=Startup.cs
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    var tenantId = Configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];
    if (tenantId != "common" && tenantId != "organizations")
    {
        options.AddPolicy("NoGuests", policy => policy.RequireClaim(
            ClaimConstants.TenantId,
            tenantId));
    }
});
```

### User Assignment in Enterprise Application

The policy successfully denies guest users access to the API.
However, it's not very user friendly, since the user won't know their denied until they call the API.
Using user assignment in Enterprise Applications, we can deny users during authentication.

Go to [Azure AD -> Enterprise Applications](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps/menuId/) and find your application (you can search by Client ID).  
Under Properties, enable `User assignment required?` and save.

![Enable User assignment required](/img/azure-user-assignment.png)

Then, go to Users and groups, and add user/group. Find users or a fitting group and assign it to the role Default Access.

:::note
Groups you select should have all users as direct members of the group. Nested groups does not work with Enterprise Applications.
:::

This should be done for all app registrations (API, Swagger and frontend).
