### Create ArgoCD Bootstrap Application

Create a new application in ArgoCD that deploys the resources in `argo/zone-2` to Argo itself.
This is called the [App Of Apps pattern](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern),
which lets us manage our ArgoCD applications as code.

The development bootstrapper can be set to automatic sync, this will make sure that your argo resources in `argo/zone2` is synced automatically when they are edited.

```
Application Name: <APP_NAME>-bootstrap
Project Name: <ARGO_PROJECT> (Example: pux)

Repository URL: https://github.com/intility/<REPO_NAME>.git
Path: argo/zone-2

Cluster URL: https://kubernetes.default.svc
Namespace: gitops-aa
```

### Production

For a production in Zone 1, you can follow the same steps as above, with some changes:

- The openshift project should be named `<APP_NAME>-prod`
- The Argo bootstrap source path should be `argo/zone-1`.
- The Argo bootstrap destination namespace should be `openshift-gitops`.
