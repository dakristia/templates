## Development Bootstrapper

Create a new application in ArgoCD to manage all your existing applications. We call this the bootstrapper. This application will reference each of your development argo resources located in the `argo/zone2`.

The development bootstrapper can be set to automatic sync, this will make sure that your argo resources in `argo/zone2` is synced automatically when they are edited.

```
Application Name: **app-name**-bootstrap
Project Name: **argo-project** (Example: pux)

Repository URL: **REPOSITORY_URL**
Path: argo/zone2

Cluster URL: https://kubernetes.default.svc
Namespace: gitops-aa
```

## Syncing

- The boostrapper syncs your applications in `argo/zone2` to ArgoCD.
- The applications in argo/zone2 syncs your helm chart to your openshift namespace.

When everything is created, ArgoCD will create new deployments in OpenShift. If ArgoCD finds any existing resources with the same names as you have specified, they will be overwritten. You can uncomment the syncPolicy: automated: {} section in the argo/zone2 resources to automatically sync changes when everything looks okay.

The `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io` annotations in your Application, connects ArgoCD Image Updater to docker images pushed with the `main` tag. This ensures you don't have to manually update image versions for dev environments, and new images are deployed once pushed.

## Production Bootstrapper

Create a new application in zone 1 ArgoCD to manage all your existing qa and prod applications. This application will reference each of your qa and production argo resources located in the `argo/zone1`.

The zone 1 bootstrapper should be set to manual sync.
