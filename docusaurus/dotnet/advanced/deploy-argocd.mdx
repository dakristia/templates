## Development Bootstrapper

Create a new application in ArgoCD to manage all your existing applications. We call this the bootstrapper. This application will reference each of your development argo resources located in the `argo/aa`.

The development bootstrapper can be set to automatic sync, this will make sure that your argo resources in `argo/aa` is synced automatically when they are edited.

![Set correct config for bootstrapper aa ](/img/4-argo-aa-config.png)

```
Application Name: **app-name**-bootstrap
Project Name: **argo-project** (Example: pux)

Repository URL: **REPOSITORY_URL**
Path: argo/aa

Cluster URL: https://kubernetes.default.svc
Namespace: gitops-aa
```

## Syncing

- The boostrapper syncs your applications in `argo/aa` to ArgoCD.
- The applications in argo/aa syncs your helm chart to your openshift namespace.

When everything is created, ensure ArgoCD recognizes the existing deployment, and doesn't try to create new resources. When Argo has taken over, you can uncomment the `syncPolicy: automated: {}` section in the `argo/aa` resources, to automatically sync changes.

The `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io` annotations in your Application, connects ArgoCD Image Updater to docker images pushed with the `main` tag. This ensures you don't have to manually update image versions for dev environments, and new images are deployed once pushed.

## Production Bootstrapper

Create a new application in the omega ArgoCD to manage all your existing qa and prod applications. This application will reference each of your qa and production argo resources located in the `argo/omega`.

The omega bootstrapper should be set to manual sync.
