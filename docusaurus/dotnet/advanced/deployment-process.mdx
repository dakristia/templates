# Deployment Process

The template includes a complete CI/CD pipeline that automates building, testing, and deploying your application to multiple environments. This guide explains how the deployment process works from GitHub workflow to production deployment.

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment process follows a GitOps approach with these key components:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Builds and publishes container images to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
2. **Release Please**: Automates versioning and release creation using conventional commits
3. **ArgoCD**: Handles deployment to Kubernetes clusters (separate instances for dev and prod)

This architecture provides:

- Fully automated deployments to development environments
- Controlled, pull request-based releases to production
- Clear separation between environments

## Container Image Creation

Container images are automatically built and published by the GitHub Actions workflow:

### Development Images

When you push to the `main` branch:

- A container image is built and tagged with `main`
- This image is used for the development environment
- The image is published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

```yaml
# Example container image for dev
ghcr.io/intility/my-service:main
```

### Production Images

When a new release tag is created (by Release Please):

- A container image is built and tagged with the semantic version (e.g., `1.2.3`)
- This image is used for the production environment
- The image is published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

```yaml
# Example container image for prod
ghcr.io/intility/my-service:1.2.3
```

## Release Please

The template integrates [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), which automates versioning and release creation using conventional commits.

### How Release Please Works

1. You write commits following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

   - `feat: add new user API` (minor version bump)
   - `fix: resolve login issue` (patch version bump)
   - `feat!: change authentication flow` (major version bump)

2. Release Please tracks these commits and automatically:
   - Creates a release PR when new commits are pushed to `main`
   - Determines the next semantic version based on commit types
   - Updates version references in your code
   - Updates the image tag in the Kustomize configuration for production

### Release Please Configuration

The template includes two Release Please configuration files:

```json title="release-please-config.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleapis/release-please/refs/heads/main/schemas/config.json",
  "packages": {
    ".": {
      "release-type": "simple",
      "extra-files": [
        {
          "type": "generic",
          "path": "k8s/overlays/production/kustomization.yaml"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```json title=".release-please-manifest.json"
{
  ".": "1.0.0"
}
```

The `extra-files` configuration ensures that when a new version is released, the image tag in your Kustomize configuration is updated to match the new version.

### Creating a Release

To create a new release:

1. Make changes to your code and commit them using conventional commit messages
2. Push your changes to the `main` branch
3. Release Please will create or update a release PR
4. Review and merge the release PR
5. Release Please will:
   - Create a new GitHub release and tag
   - Update the image tag in the production Kustomize configuration
   - Trigger the GitHub workflow to build and publish a new production image

## ArgoCD Deployment

The template is configured with two separate ArgoCD configurations, one for development and one for production.

### Development Environment (Automatic Updates)

The development ArgoCD application is configured with automatic image updates:

```yaml title="argo/aa/dev-application.yaml"
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-service-dev
  annotations:
    argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list: ghcr.io/intility/my-service:main
    argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/update-strategy: digest
    argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/force-update: 'true'
spec:
  project: MyProject
  destination:
    namespace: my-namespace-dev
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/intility/my-service.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: k8s/overlays/dev
```

Key features:

- Uses ArgoCD Image Updater annotations
- Automatically deploys new images when the digest changes (same tag, new content)
- Points to the `dev` overlay in the Kustomize configuration
- Uses the `main` branch image tag

### Production Environment (Controlled Updates)

The production ArgoCD application is configured for controlled updates:

```yaml title="argo/omega/prod-application.yaml"
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-service-prod
spec:
  project: MyProject
  destination:
    namespace: my-namespace-prod
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/intility/my-service.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: k8s/overlays/production
```

Key features:

- No automatic image updater annotations
- Manual sync required
- Points to the `production` overlay in the Kustomize configuration
- When Release Please updates the image tag in the Kustomize config, ArgoCD shows "out of sync"

## Deployment Workflow

Here's how the entire process works:

### Development Deployment

1. Developer pushes changes to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow builds and publishes a new image with the `main` tag
3. ArgoCD Image Updater detects the new image digest
4. ArgoCD automatically deploys the new image to the development environment

### Production Deployment

1. Developer pushes commits with conventional commit messages to `main` branch
2. Release Please creates or updates a release PR
3. Developer reviews and merges the release PR
4. Release Please:
   - Creates a new GitHub release and tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
   - Updates the image tag in the production Kustomize configuration
5. GitHub Actions workflow builds and publishes a new image with the version tag
6. ArgoCD detects the configuration change (updated image tag)
7. You review the changes and manually syncs the production ArgoCD application
