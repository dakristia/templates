It's recommended to run this command every time you want to use the template,
to ensure you're using the newest version.

New templates should now be available to bootstrap new projects from. Use `dotnet new list` to see available templates

## Available Templates

Intility.Templates provides two main templates to help you quickly bootstrap new .NET projects following Intility's best practices and architectural patterns:

### Intility Api (`iwebapi`)

The Intility Api template is designed for creating HTTP-based API services. Use this template when you need to:

- Build RESTful APIs that other services or applications will consume
- Create endpoints for frontend applications
- Develop microservices with HTTP communication
- Expose functionality through a web-based interface

### Intility Worker (`iworker`)

The Intility Worker template is designed for background processing services. Use this template when you need to:

- Process work asynchronously
- Create scheduled jobs or recurring tasks
- Implement message queue consumers
- Build services that don't require HTTP endpoints
- Develop data processing pipelines

Select the appropriate template based on your service's primary responsibility and communication patterns.

:::warning
While not required, we highly recommend creating your GitHub repository, Azure App Registrations, OpenShift namespace, and Argo project beforehand. This allows the template to utilize inputs for ClientId, OpenShift namespace, Argo project, and GitHub repo URL, facilitating the pre-configuration of the project. If you follow the guide, these sections will also come before creating a project locally.
:::

## Updating the template

:::warning
Earlier versions of the CLI had troubles updating packages due to long-lived caches.
You need to be on version 5.0.301 or higher for updating to work properly.
:::

:::note
This will not update already bootstrapped projects.
:::

Check for updates by running

```shell
dotnet new update --check-only
```

If there are any updates available, update with

```shell
dotnet new update
```

or

```shell
dotnet new install Intility.Templates
```
