First and foremost make sure you have installed the [official dotnet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 9.

```shell
#install intility templates
dotnet new install Intility.Templates
```

:::info
It's recommended to run this command every time you want to use the template,
to ensure you're using the newest version.
:::

New templates should now be available to bootstrap new projects from. Use `dotnet new list` to see available templates

## Available Templates

Intility.Templates provides two main templates to help you quickly bootstrap new .NET projects following Intility's best practices and architectural patterns:

### Intility Api (`iwebapi`)

The Intility Api template is designed for creating HTTP-based API services. Use this template when you need to:

- Build RESTful APIs that other services or applications will consume
- Create endpoints for frontend applications
- Develop microservices with HTTP communication
- Expose functionality through a web-based interface

### Intility Worker (`iworker`)

The Intility Worker template is designed for background processing services. Use this template when you need to:

- Process work asynchronously
- Create scheduled jobs or recurring tasks
- Implement message queue consumers
- Build services that don't require HTTP endpoints
- Develop data processing pipelines

Select the appropriate template based on your service's primary responsibility and communication patterns.

## Bootstrap new project using the template

You can either use the `dotnet new` command or Visual Studio -> New Project wizard to create a new project based on the templates.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  groupId="host"
  defaultValue="cli"
  values={[
    { label: "dotnet CLI", value: "cli" },
    { label: "Visual Studio", value: "vs" }
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="cli">

:::note
If you only want to create a project, and skip creating a solution, use the `--project` argument.
:::

```shell
# create project with solution
dotnet new iwebapi -o MyService

# create project only
dotnet new iwebapi -o MyService --project

# run project
cd MyService
dotnet run --project MyService/MyService.csproj
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vs">

:::note
You need to be on Visual Studio 16.10.0 or higher for the solution template to work properly.
:::

Find the template named `Intility Api`.

![Visual Studio new](/img/visual-studio-new.png)

Name your project, and ensure `Place solution and project in the same directory` is checked.

![Visual Studio new solution](/img/visual-studio-new-solution.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Updating the template

:::warning
Earlier versions of the CLI had troubles updating packages due to long-lived caches.
You need to be on version 5.0.301 or higher for updating to work properly.
:::

:::note
This will not update already bootstrapped projects.
:::

Check for updates by running

```shell
dotnet new update --check-only
```

If there are any updates available, update with

```shell
dotnet new update
```

or

```shell
dotnet new install Intility.Templates
```
