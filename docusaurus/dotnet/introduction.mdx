Intility Templates for .NET.

When you normally run `dotnet new webapi`, you get a great simple starting point for developing restul APIs locally.
However, the next steps are not instantly clear.

- How to I setup proper authentication?
- What are the best practices for configuration?
- How do I address operational concerns such as logging and telemetry?
- And how do I get up and running with CI/CD?

These very opinionated templates aims to give developers battle-tested defaults for Intility projects using dotnet.<br />
**Using this template you should be <ins>production ready</ins> in no time!** ðŸš€
