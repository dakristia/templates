# OpenShift and ArgoCD

## Create project in OpenShift

Go to our [OpenShift instance](https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.intility.com/) and log in as Intility Developer.

Create a project, the name should be aa-GITHUB_REPO_SLUG-dev, e.g. aa-my-api-dev.
Add a fitting display name and description if you feel like it.

:::note
This is the namespace that will be used later on when creating a project from the template.

## Create project in ArgoCD

Navigate to [ArgoCD](https://argo.apps.int.intility.no/) and log in using Single Sign-On (SSO).

In most cases, a project will already exist for you. If not, you can create a new one via the [Projects Settings page.](https://argo.apps.int.intility.no/settings/projects).

### Configure GitHub Access and Namespace Permissions

After successfully creating your ArgoCD project, you need to ensure it is configured to:

- Access source code from GitHub

- Deploy to your OpenShift namespace

To do this, go to **Settings → Projects → Your Project**, and configure the following:

#### Source Repositories

Add the GitHub repository pattern:

```
https://github.com/intility**
```

#### Destinations

Add the OpenShift cluster and your specific namespace as deployment targets:

```
https://kubernetes.default.svc
in-cluster
aa-my-api-dev
```

> ✅ These configurations ensure ArgoCD can pull application manifests from GitHub and deploy to the correct namespace in OpenShift.

:::warning  
You may not have the necessary permissions to make these changes to your ArgoCD project.  
If that’s the case, please reach out in the **Developer Infrastructure** channel for assistance.
