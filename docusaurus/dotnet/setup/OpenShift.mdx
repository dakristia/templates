# OpenShift and ArgoCD

## Create project in OpenShift

Go to our [OpenShift instance](https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.intility.com/) and log in as Intility Developer.

Create a project, the name should be aa-GITHUB_REPO_SLUG-dev, e.g. aa-my-api-dev.
Add a fitting display name and description if you feel like it.

:::note
This is the namespace that will be used later on when creating a project from the template.

## Create project in ArgoCD

Go to [ArgoCD](https://argo.apps.int.intility.no/) and log in with SSO.

You probably have a project created already, but if not, you can create a new project [here](https://argo.apps.int.intility.no/settings/projects).
