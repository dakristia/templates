# GitHub Actions Workflow and Dependabot

The template comes with a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow that builds, tests, and deploys your application using Intility's reusable workflow.

## Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow in the template uses a [reusable workflow](https://github.com/intility/reusable-workflows) approach, which provides several benefits:

- **Consistency**: All services use the same build, test, and publish process
- **Maintainability**: Updates to the workflow can be made in one place
- **Simplicity**: Project configuration is minimal and focused on your specific needs
- **Security**: Built-in security features like vulnerability scanning and artifact attestation

## Workflow Configuration

The workflow is configured to run when:

- Pushing to the `main` branch
- Creating a pull request against the `main` branch
- Creating a new tag (used for releases)

Here's what the workflow file looks like:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/build-and-push.yaml"
name: build, test and publish

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    uses: intility/reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/dotnet.yaml@main
    with:
      directory: ./
      docker: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
```

## What the Workflow Does

The reusable workflow performs the following tasks:

1. **Setup**: Configures the .NET SDK environment
2. **Restore**: Restores NuGet dependencies
3. **Test**: Runs your application's test suite
4. **Build**: Builds the .NET application
5. **Container**: Creates a container image using the built-in container support in .NET
6. **Publish**: Pushes the container image to GitHub Container Registry
7. **Attest**: Generates security attestations for the container image

## Customization Options

The reusable workflow accepts several input parameters you can customize:

| Parameter        | Description                                      | Default                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `directory`      | The directory where your .NET project is located | `.`                                           |
| `dotnet-version` | The .NET SDK version to use                      | `9.x.x`                                       |
| `dotnet-quality` | Quality channel for .NET SDK                     | `ga`                                          |
| `dotnet-source`  | Custom NuGet repository source                   | GitHub Packages                               |
| `test`           | Whether to run tests                             | `true`                                        |
| `docker`         | Whether to build and push the container image    | `true` for branch/tag pushes, `false` for PRs |
| `tags`           | Container image tagging strategy                 | Uses semantic versioning pattern              |

## Container Image Publishing

The workflow automatically publishes container images to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) when:

- Pushing to the `main` branch (tagged with the branch name)
- Creating a new tag (tagged with the semantic version)

Container images are not published for pull requests to ensure security.

5. **Security Updates**: Beyond the scheduled updates, Dependabot also creates PRs for security vulnerabilities as they're discovered.

## Built-in Container Support

Instead of using Dockerfiles, the template leverages the [built-in container support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/containers/sdk-publish) in the .NET SDK:

```bash
dotnet publish --os linux-musl --arch x64 /t:PublishContainer
```

This modern approach simplifies the container creation process and ensures consistency between your development and production environments.

## Security Features

The workflow includes security features:

1. **Build provenance attestation**: Generates SLSA Level 3 attestations for container images
2. **Dependency scanning**: Can be extended to scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Secure publishing**: Uses GitHub-provided secrets for secure registry access

For more information about the reusable workflow, see the [reusable-workflows repository](https://github.com/intility/reusable-workflows).

## Dependabot Integration

The template includes preconfigured Dependabot settings to keep your dependencies up-to-date automatically. This is configured in the `.github/dependabot.yaml` file:

```yaml title=".github/dependabot.yaml"
version: 2
updates:
  # Check for updates to nuget packages
  - package-ecosystem: 'nuget'
    directory: '/'
    schedule:
      interval: 'monthly'
      time: '09:00'
      timezone: 'Europe/Oslo'
    labels:
      - 'dependencies'
      - 'nuget'
    commit-message:
      prefix: 'build:'
    groups:
      # Group all non-major updates together
      minor-patch-updates:
        patterns:
          - '*'
        update-types:
          - 'minor'
          - 'patch'

  # Check for updates to GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: 'github-actions'
    directory: '/'
    schedule:
      interval: 'monthly'
      time: '09:00'
      timezone: 'Europe/Oslo'
    labels:
      - 'dependencies'
      - 'github-actions'
    commit-message:
      prefix: 'ci:'
```

### How Dependabot Works

1. **Scheduled Scans**: Dependabot checks for updates to both NuGet packages and GitHub Actions on a monthly basis at 09:00 Europe/Oslo time.

2. **Grouped Updates**: For NuGet packages, minor and patch updates are grouped together into a single pull request to reduce noise.

3. **Labeled Pull Requests**: Dependabot PRs are automatically labeled with "dependencies" and either "nuget" or "github-actions" for easy filtering.

4. **Conventional Commits**:

   - NuGet updates use the `build:` prefix
   - GitHub Actions updates use the `ci:` prefix

   This follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) pattern and integrates with release-please for automated versioning.
