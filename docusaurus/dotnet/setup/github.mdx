Go to [New Project in GitHub](https://github.com/new).

Select a fitting name, it should be as globally unique and descriptive for your project as possible.

## Pushing your application

Creating a dotnet project from a template does not automatically create a git repository for you,
so we have to make one ourselves.
Follow the "Push an existing folder" example,
which should look something like this:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:intility/intility-app.git
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add intility-app base"
git push -u origin main
```
