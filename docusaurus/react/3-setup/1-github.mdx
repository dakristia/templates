## Pushing your application

Creating a project from a template does not automatically create a git repository for you,
so we have to make one ourselves.
Follow the "Push an existing folder" example,
which should look something like this:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:intility/intility-app.git
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initialize application"
git push -u origin main
```
