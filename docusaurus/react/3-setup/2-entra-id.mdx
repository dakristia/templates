The example code is set up to use authentication. For this to work, an App Registration has to be set up in Entra ID.

### Create App Registration

Head over to [Azure -> Entra ID -> App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)
with your Intility Account, and create a new registration.

![New Registration in Azure](/img/azure-new.png)  
Select a fitting name for your project, this name will be presented to the user during consent.

Under `Supported account types`, choose either `Intility AS only - Single tenant` or `Any Microsoft Entra ID directory - Multitenant`.
This can be changed later, so if you're unsure what to choose, select single tenant.

Under `Redirect URI`, select `Single-page application (SPA)` from the dropdown, and enter `http://localhost:3000`.

Hit the register button, and you will be taken to an overview of your newly created registration.

Check out [Enabling authentication in your app](#enabling-authentication-in-your-app) to enable authentication in your app.

### Adding reply URLs

For each deployment of your app, you'll need to register it. You can do that by going to the Authentication page.

![Adding Reply URLs](/img/azure-replyurls.png)  
The first we need to add is the URL the deploy step makes in OpenShift:

```
https://{your-project-slug}-dev.apps.int.intility.no
```

You can also add more later if you create more environments.

## Enabling authentication in your app

Depending on what your applications scope is, there are different ways of enabling authentication.

### Forcing auth

This is the simplest way, and can be enabled by wrapping your application in `MsalAuthenticationTemplate` from `@azure/msal-react`.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { MsalAuthenticationTemplate, MsalProvider } from '@azure/msal-react';
import { loginRequest } from './auth/config';
import { InteractionType } from '@azure/msal-browser';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <StrictMode>
      <ColorModeApplier>
        <MsalProvider instance={msalInstance}>
          {/* Adding this component will force authentication, needs to be between the MsalProvider and RouterProvider */}
          <MsalAuthenticationTemplate
            interactionType={InteractionType.Redirect}
            authenticationRequest={loginRequest}
          >
            <RouterProvider router={router} />
          </MsalAuthenticationTemplate>
        </MsalProvider>
      </ColorModeApplier>
    </StrictMode>
  );
}
```

This will force user authentication, and your app won't render unless the user is authenticated.

### Other methods

There are many ways to protect your application, both conditionally and forced.

Read the [`@azure/msal-react` docs](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-react/docs/getting-started.md) to see other ways to authenticate.

## Consuming an authenticated API

To consume an authenticated API you will need to add permission. You can do this by going to your frontend application registration in Azure, under API Permissions.
Click "Add a permission" and follow the steps to add the api scope you need.

The permission you add will have a scope looking something like `api://application-guid/scopename`, which you will use as the `'API_SCOPE'` variable in the next steps below.

![API Permissions](/img/azure-api-permissions2.png)

If the API you want to consume requires user consent you'll need to add the api scope to the `authenticationRequest` scopes.

```tsx title="src/auth/config.ts"
/**
 * Default login request for the app
 */
export const loginRequest: RedirectRequest = {
  scopes: ['User.Read', 'API_SCOPE'],
};
```

You'll also need to modify the `authorizedFetch` method, and acquire the correct scopes for the URL you're trying to call.

```tsx title="src/auth/authorizedFetch.ts"
async function authorizedFetch() {
  ...
  if (url?.toLowerCase().startsWith('https://graph.microsoft.com/')) {
    scopes.push('User.Read');
  } else if (url?.toLowerCase().startsWith('http://localhost:5000/')) {
    scopes.push('API_SCOPE');
  }
  ...
}
```

The API base URL can also be dynamically applied from [Environment Variables](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode).

```tsx title="src/auth/authorizedFetch.ts"
async function authorizedFetch() {
  ...
  if (url?.toLowerCase().startsWith('https://graph.microsoft.com/')) {
    scopes.push('User.Read');
  } else if (url?.toLowerCase().startsWith(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL)) {
    scopes.push('API_SCOPE');
  }
  ...
}
```

You can now consume an API with `authorizedFetch`, which uses the `endpoints` config to detect which token to use in a request.
