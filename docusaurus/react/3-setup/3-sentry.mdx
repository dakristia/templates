The project comes included with error reporting to Sentry, and a workflow that uploads sourcemaps and creates releases.
To set this up, we'll need to create a project in Sentry, the project DSN and an auth token.

### Create Project

Head over to the [Create a new Project page in Sentry](https://sentry.intility.no/organizations/intility/projects/new/).

![Sentry Platform Select](/img/sentry-new-platform.png)

Under platform, select React.

![Sentry New Project Name](/img/sentry-new-name.png)

Choose a fitting project name, preferably the same as your GitHub repository name.  
Select a fitting team, or create a new one, and hit Create.

You'll be taken to a Configure React page.
In the code example under Connecting the SDK to Sentry, copy the `dsn` value, and add it to [GitHub Action variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository) with the name `SENTRY_DSN`.
