:::tip Find and Replace
Find and replace `__APP_NAME__` in the codebase with a [kubernetes-friendly name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/).
E.g. `intility-app` or `app-frontend`
:::

:::tip Find and Replace
Find and replace `__ARGO_PROJECT__` in the codebase with your project in Argo.
Usually your department's project.
:::

Let's set up a development environment for your project.

:::info
To create a production environment, follow the same steps, but in Zone 1 or another cluster. The OpenShift name should be `<APP_NAME>-prod`.
:::

## Create OpenShift Project

Go to [our OpenShift instance](https://console.apps.openshift.intility.com/) and log in as Intility Developer.

Create a project, the name should be `aa-__APP_NAME__-dev`, e.g. `aa-intility-app-dev`.  
Add a fitting display name and description if you feel like it.

## ArgoCD

Navigate to [ArgoCD](https://argo.apps.int.intility.no/) and log in using Single Sign-On (SSO).

### Add OpenShift Destination

Go to **Settings → Projects → Your Project**, and configure the following destinations:

```
https://kubernetes.default.svc
in-cluster
aa-<APP_NAME>-dev
```

:::warning  
You may not have the necessary permissions to make these changes to your ArgoCD project.  
If that's the case, please reach out in the **Developer Infrastructure** channel for assistance.  
:::

### Create ArgoCD Bootstrap Application

Create a new application in ArgoCD that deploys the resources in `argo/zone-2` to Argo itself.
This is called the [App Of Apps pattern](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern),
which lets us manage our ArgoCD applications as code.

The development bootstrapper can be set to automatic sync, this will make sure that your argo resources in `argo/zone2` is synced automatically when they are edited.

![Set correct config for bootstrapper zone2 ](/img/argo-bootstrapper-new-2.png)

```
Application Name: <APP_NAME>-bootstrap
Project Name: <ARGO_PROJECT> (Example: pux)

Repository URL: https://github.com/intility/<REPO_NAME>.git
Path: argo/zone-2

Cluster URL: https://kubernetes.default.svc
Namespace: gitops-aa
