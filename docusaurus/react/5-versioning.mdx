title: Version Management
sidebar_position: 5

The template comes included with [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), a tool for automating versioning and generating changelogs.

It will check the git history for [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary), and based on the commit messages, it will determine the next [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/).

When it determines that your app should be versioned, it will create a pull request to version the app. The pull request will:

- Update the version in `package.json`
- Create a changelog entry in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Bump the version in `k8s/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml`

Once merged, it will:

- Create a new release in GitHub
- Create a new Docker image with the new version number

Because the production overlay was updated, you can go straight to ArgoCD and sync the application.

## Semver

Summary from [semver.org](https://semver.org/):

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
1. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible
   manner
1. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Conventional Commits

Summary from [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history;
which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
This convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org),
by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

---

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

---

<br />
The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the
consumers of your library:

1. **fix:** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
1. **feat:** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
   A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
1. _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends `build:`, `chore:`,
   `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
1. _footers_ other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to
   [git trailer format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

## Removing Release Please

If you want to remove Release Please from your project, and use another way to version your app, you can do so by removing the following files:

- `.github/release-please-config.json`
- `.github/release-please-manifest.json`
- `.github/workflows/release-please.yaml`
